# Energy Analysis: Spike RBDâ€“ACE2 Protein-Protein Interface

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project explores the interface of the Spike RBDâ€“ACE2 protein complex. Our goal is to understand how individual residues contribute to binding energyâ€”one of the main factors explaining the interaction stability within this complex.

## ðŸš€ Installation and Setup

To replicate our pipeline and obtain the same results, follow the steps outlined below:

### Preparation: Cleaning the Structure

1. **Download** the PDB structure for `6m0j`.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install biobb_structure_checking biopython
   ```
3. **Run** the cleaning script:
   ```bash
   python preparation.py
   ```
   - Finds chains
   - Removes heteroatoms
   - Performs a quality check

## ðŸ”¬ Step-by-Step Pipeline

### Step 1: Finding Interface Residues

- Open `6m0j_fixed` in **PyMOL**.
- Identify the largest distance between potentially interacting residues across chains.
- Add 2 Ã… to the measured distance to include adjacent residues.
- Run:
  ```bash
  python step1.py
  ```
  - Outputs a list of interface residues in both chains.

### Step 2: Finding Interaction Energies

- **Download and install**:
  - `vdwprm`, `aaLib.lib` (from GitHub/Moodle)
  - `NACCESS`
  - Install NACCESS:
    ```bash
    csh install.scr
    ```
- Run:
  ```bash
  python step2.py
  ```
  - Calculates:
    - Total complex energy
    - Interface energy
  - Compares energies and extracts conclusions

---

### Step 3: Alanine Scanning Experiment

- Run:
  ```bash
  python step3.py
  ```
  - Mutates interface residues to alanine (ALA)
  - Calculates energy changes for each mutation
  - Outputs a table of energy differences
  - Generates a barplot for visualization

---

### Step 4: Generating PyMOL Images

- Open `6m0j_fixed` in **PyMOL**
- Follow the provided pipeline (`pymol_pipeline.txt`) to:
  - Highlight interface
  - Capture images of mutations and bond changes
