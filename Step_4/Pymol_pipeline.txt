PYMOL

1.color by chain: 
util.cbc

2.make selections of the chains using the sequence.
	in this case ChainA, chainE

3.to get interface: 
select interface1, byres ChainA within 4.3 of ChainE  #residues of interface in chainA
#select interface2, byres ChainE within 4.3 of ChainA ?

4.
Action > find > polar contacts > with any atoms
color them magenta

5.
Show lines for ChainA and ChainE

6. for easier visualization
color by atoms

7. Select the interactions between chains manually

8. Wizard > Mesurement > Distances
	*Merge with previous -> to obtain all in one object
	Retrace each of the interactions measuring each of the interactions
	
9. take pictures

ALA SCANNING
1. select interested aminoacid
2. color it
3. label residue
4. Wizard > Mutagenesis > click on no mutation and change it into ALA
5. label it again
6. find if it does the same interaction and the distance
7. take picture
